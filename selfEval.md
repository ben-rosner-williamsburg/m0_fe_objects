# Self-Evaluation

- WThis final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges? 
The final ask (Part 3) was a bit daunting, but I was able to figure it out based on putting together what I have learned so far, as well as past experiences in coding. It was definitely a challenge, but it was a productive struggle. 

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
I think my workflow is going well. I'm able to use the Pomodoro method to help take breaks and stay focused. Every 25 minutes I take a break for 5 minutes, and every three rounds of that I take a 15 minute break in place of the 5 minute break. It's very helpful for staying focused and ensures that I get all my work done.

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
I want to remember that you can create an array of objects, as I know that is something that confused me a bit in my previous coding experience. I also reinforced my knowledge on how to log to the console object keys and values, as well as how to add key value pairs to an object using dot notation.
